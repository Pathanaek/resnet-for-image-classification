Overview:

This project implements a Residual Neural Network (ResNet) to do image classification tasks. The goal was to develop a generic model capable of classifying various image categories. Made for ACM Mlab 2023 Onboarding Project.

Usage:

1. Load your dataset into the project directory (must be an hdf5 bundle).
2. Modify utils.load_data() in utils.py to correctly preprocess the images.
3. Feel free to adjust hyperparameters as needed.
4. Run the script to train the model: python image_classification.py
5. Use the trained model to classify new images!
